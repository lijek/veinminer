# Veinminer
Mod that allows to mine multiple blocks that are connected together.
For now it has basic functionality and some mining mods.
Default vein mining key is `~`. Mine a block with `~` to vein mine.
You can see a list of modes in left top corner if you hold the key.
To change mode you press shift & the `~` and scroll with your mouse wheel.
